                    Moving on to part 12, we are an audience to Sage
                    Vishvamitaâ€™s narration of the tale of Emperor Sagara and the
                    follies committed by his sixty thousand sons BY Vanam Jwala

                    Mar 2020 9:21 PM Vishvamitra narrated the story of Emperor
                    Sagara as follows, "In ancient days, Sagara was the Emperor
                    of Ayodhya. He was feeling deprived as he had no children.
                    Sagara had two wives. Daughter of king Vidarbha by name
                    Keshini was his elder wife and the daughter of Arishtanemi
                    by the name of Sumathi was the second wife. Emperor Sagara
                    penanced and practised abstinence for a hundred years. On
                    completion of a hundred years, Sage Bhrugu appeared to
                    Sagara and bequeathed two boons to him. He said that one of
                    his wives will give birth to a son who would enrich Sagara
                    dynasty and the other wife will be blessed with sixty
                    thousand sons. Keshini preferred one single son and Sumathi
                    desired to have sixty thousand sons as per her free will.
                    After a while, both of them became pregnant".

                  <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                    "As destined, Keshini gave birth to one son who became known
                    as Asamanja and Sumathi gave birth to sixty thousand sons
                    through one single egg. The eldest son Asamanja turned
                    criminal and started hurling children into the Sarayu River,
                    smiling as he saw them drown. On witnessing the ominous and
                    sadistic activity of his son, his father Sagara banished him
                    from the city and sent him to forests. Asamanja's son,
                    Anshuman, however, was noble in his bearing and became
                    popular as a well-wisher of people. At this moment, Emperor
                    Sagara took a decision to perform the Ashvamedha Ritual".
                    Indra abducting the ritual horse of Sagara performing
                    Ashvamedha Yaga "Sagara, on deciding the best place for
                    performing Ashvamedha Yaga as the one that was in between
                    the two great mountains namely Himalayas and Vindhyas, made
                    all arrangements systematically. Sagara designated his
                    grandson Anshuman to escort the ritual horse and accordingly
                    he did so. Halfway through the ritual, Indra assumed the
                    form of a monster and stole the ritual horse. The Ritwiks
                    and the religious priests in charge of the ritual
                    proceedings advised Sagara to fetch the horse to perform the
                    ritual uninterruptedly without any hindrance lest it may
                    become inauspicious. Immediately, Sagara ordered his sixty
                    thousand sons to search the entire world inch by inch and
                    retrieve the horse at the earliest. Accordingly, all of them
                    went in search of the horse while Sagara stayed back at the
                    ritual place along with Anshuman".

                    Sindhu Valley civilization is the mother civilization of
                    Hindus and Kadva Patidars (and most of the North Indians).
                    It was established between BC7000 and BC2000 and started
                    shrinking in BC1600. It covered 1.2 million square
                    kilometers (400,000 square miles) from Kashmir in north to
                    Godavari River in south and from Delhi in east to Arabian
                    Sea in west. It was a most advanced civilization with
                    farming, commerce, and social amenities. Its inhabitants had
                    established standards, based on decimal system, for weight,
                    length, area, and volume measurements. They had engineering
                    and technical skills for transportation, farming equipment,
                    metal working, and town planning. They had a language with
                    26 readable and writable characters. It was written from
                    left to right. They were followers of Shiva.

                    Sage Kapila rendering Sagara sons to heaps of ashes Sage
                    Vishvamitra, continuing his narration of Sagara legend
                    further said, "Lord Brahma pacified them. He assured them
                    that Vasudeva, who was none other than Lord Vishnu himself,
                    donning the resemblance of Sage Kapila will burn down the
                    sons of Sagara to heaps of ashes and hence they need not
                    worry. Assuaged, the Devatas happily returned to their
                    respective abodes". "Meanwhile, the sons of Sagara were
                    unable to find the ritual horse or its abductor, despite
                    digging and trekking the whole earth. They went to their
                    father and informed him of the same. Getting angry with
                    them, Emperor Sagara ordered them to go forthwith and trace
                    the horse as well as catch hold of the thief. On hearing
                    this, the sixty thousand sons of Sagara left the place and
                    dug through the earth till Rasa Thala, the last layer of the
                    earth. There, they noticed a gigantic elephant, namely
                    Virupaksha which was bearing the eastern side of earth's
                    surface on its head. They circumambulated by walking around
                    the elephant and worshipped it. Later they dug in the South
                    where they saw yet another elephant namely Mahapadma. They
                    greeted and saluted it too and moved towards scooping out
                    the western side where again they saw another elephant
                    called Soumanasa. They greeted it also and went towards the
                    northern direction by continuing their digging activity. In
                    the north, they saw Bhadra, a snow-white elephant with which
                    they exchanged pleasantries. The Sagara sons then continued
                    to the north-east direction". "While they were digging the
                    earth at one place, they saw Vasudeva in the form of the
                    Sage Kapila along with their ritual horse by his side and
                    all were delighted. Unaware of who Vasudeva was, the Sagara
                    sons dubbed him as the thief and attributed the theft of
                    ritual horse to him, heaping upon him malicious and
                    unpalatable words. Then, overwhelmed with high fury, the
                    Sage Kapila, with his unimaginable power, rendered all those
                    sons of Sagara as heaps of ashes." Thus, narrated sage
                    Vishvamitra and continued further.
